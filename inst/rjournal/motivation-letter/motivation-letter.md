Dear Professor Loo,
\bigskip

Please consider my article titled "Adding tables in R: Introducing the
`frab` package" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new `frab` package that provides
functionality for working with single- and multi- dimensional tables
in R.  It also gives a new interpretation for named vectors.

The package has potentially wide applications in that it provides new
R infrastructure.
