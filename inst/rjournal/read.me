Various auxiliary files are needed to create frabRJ.pdf.

The bibliography file, frab.bib, is under version control in that
vignettes/ package directory.  Copy it here to process frabR.Rmd.  The
figure, commuting_diagram.pdf, is created from commuting_diagram.tex
(which is under version control) by running

pdflatex commuting_diagram

Use 

rmarkdown::render("frabRJ.Rmd")

In an R session to create frabRJ.Rmd and frabRJ.html
