# Overview

The `frab` package furnishes an alternative interpretation of named
vectors wherein addition is defined using the (unique) names as the
primary key.  This allows one to "add" tables in a consistent and
meaningful way.  The underlying mathematical object is the Free
Abelian group.

# The package in use

The package has a single S4 class of objects, `frab`.  Primary
construction function `frab()` takes a named vector and returns a
`frab` object:


```{r use1}
suppressMessages(library("frab"))
frab(c(x=1,b=2,a=2,b=3,c=7,x=-1))
```

Above, we see from the return value that function `frab()` has
reordered the labels of its argument, calculated the value for entry
`b` [as $2+3=5$], determined that the entry for `x` has vanished [the
values cancelling out], and printed the result using a bespoke show
method.  However, the package's most useful feature is the overloaded
definition of addition:


```{r label=additionoverload}
(x <- rfrab())
(y <- rfrab())
x+y
```
