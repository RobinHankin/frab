# Named vectors

A _named vector_ is a vector with a `names` attribute.  Each
element of a named vector is associated with a name or label.  The
names are not necessarily unique.  It allows you to assign a name to
each element, making it easier to refer to specific values within the
vector using their respective names.

Named vectors are a convenient and useful feature of the R programming
language.  However, given the following two named vectors:

```{r}
x <- c(a=1,b=2,c=3)
y <- c(c=4,b=1,a=1)
```

Given that `x+y` returns a named vector, there are at least two
plausible values that it might give, viz:

`c(a=5,b=3,c=4)`

or

`c(a=2,b=3,c=7)`.

In the first case the elements of `x` and `y` are added pairwise, and
the `names` attribute is taken from the _first_ of the addends.  In
the second, the names are considered to be primary and the value of
each name in the sum is the sum of the values of that name of the
addends.  Note further that there is no good reason why the first
answer could not be `c(c=5,b=3,a=4)`, obtained by using the names
attribute of `y` instead of `x`.

The `frab` package furnishes consistent and efficient methods to give
the second answer: uses the names of a named vector as the indexing
mechanism.  Package idiom is straightforward:

```{r}
(x <- frab(c(a=1,b=2,c=3)))
(y <- frab(c(c=4,b=1,a=1)))
x+y
```



```{r}
x <- frab(c(x=5,d=1,e=2,f=4,a=3,c=3,g=9))
x
x>3
x<3
x[x>3]
x[x<3]
x[x<3] <- 100
x
```

Tables work nicely too:

```{r}
a <- rfrab()
b <- table(sample(letters[1:8],12,replace=T))
a
b
a+b
```
